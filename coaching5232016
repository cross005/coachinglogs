Strictly limit your escalation percentage to 4%. This is one of the major keys in lowering your HACR. To do this, you must: a) Increase your confidence in converting and sending hard messages. b) Manage your escalation. We have already identified the scoring times for PULL messages which is 1700-2000 and 2200-0100 and you were advised not to escalate messages except during these times. c) Treat the escalation as your final resort and not an escape route or an option.\r\n\r\n2. Practice LAR. You may do your Google research during listening phase. This will actually improve both your QA and HACR.\r\n\r\n3. Maximize all available hot keys. You may view them by pressing F2.\r\n\r\n4. You may also utilize the Typing Pal application during idle times to improve your typing skills.\r\n','','Strictly follow our Action Plans.\r\n\r\nKindly state any additional action plans that you think will help you to lower your HACR down.','               I will try to lower my escalation.\r\n               \r\n              ','Will check your Weekly HACR performance on Monday, January 18 and will do weekly performance comparison to see if there&#039;s any improvement made.','leonardo.ampioco.jpg','von.delrosario.jpg','jairus.delossantos.jpg','Ok','Ok','Ok','Approved','von.delrosario','01/13/16 8:12','01/14/16 2:10','01/17/16 5:34'),(479,'20160113182406','joemarie.deles','von.delrosario',21901,'dina.decastro','De Castro, Dina','14:00-23:30','01/13/16 6:24','','You just recently signed an Incident Report for the second offense of Failed Monthly Performance Evaluation (MPE) for the month of December 2015.\r\n\r\nBased on our scorecard as of January 12, 2016, your overall rating is at 1.80.

You must bounce back from your critical error last January 5th and make sure every message you will send is 100% perfect. Take advantage of the identified PULL scoring times. Utilize Google search to identify names, places and company names. Ask for second opinion to avoid critical errors and use your escalation wisely.\r\n\r\nHACR target is at 3.0.

The good thing is that you are able to recognize them. Now what we need to do is for you to recognize them on real time. If you will be able to do this then you will be spare several possible markdowns in the future. The best thing to do is review the tricky parts. Anyway it will not affect your HACR because not all messages have tricky parts. Identify the hard messages and focus on them.

Your shift for the day was late. Thus to ensure that you will have a good Quality score there was an instruction to you to focus and prioritize your Quality.

Your BaseCamp HACR is outstanding thuis recovery on your MTD HACR is expected on the coming days.

In order to do that you need to have a good comprehension of the message. Make sure that you understand what the message is all about. The moment you understand it, that&#039;s the time you need to check your message if it fits the context. If your conversion doesn&#039;t fit then there is a possibility of errors. Make sure that the words are associated with each other. Next point is for you to have a word by word perfect conversion. Check the number of syllables. It should match with the audio, otherwise your conversion is an error. The most damaging error are Critical Errors. They must be avoided. What are the messages you need to tag as Unconvertible? you should know it. In lay mans term, those that are not in English and messages wherein more than 50% cannot be converted. Otherwise convert the message. \r\n\r\n2) Push Quality Score - They are identified messages. You need to check the message ID of all messages, no excuse on this one. Make sure that before you start your shift, you are already aware of the Push messages converted by the Agents on the earlier shift. This is an advantage you have over them. Best conversion is needed on Push messages. On converting Push messages make sure that you will convert the message first from the start to the end before reviewing or asking assistance. This is a safeguard against message snatch back. Then start reviewing. Use Google, ask for assistance if needed. We have suggestions but the decision is always yours. Use your skill on determining the correct conversion.\r\n\r\nHACR: \r\n\r\nBe guided by the BaseCamp so that you will know if you are on track or if your HACR is spiking up. Avoid recovering on HACR as this will affect your Quality.

In order to do that you need to have a good comprehension of the message. Make sure that you understand what the message is all about.

Make sure that the words are associated with each other. Next point is for you to have a word by word perfect conversion. Check the number of syllables. It should match with the audio, otherwise your conversion is an error. The most damaging error are Critical Errors. They must be avoided.

Best conversion is needed on Push messages. On converting Push messages make sure that you will convert the message first from the start to the end before reviewing or asking assistance.

In order to do that you need to have a good comprehension of the message. Make sure that you understand what the message is all about. The moment you understand it, that&#039;s the time you need to check your message if it fits the context. If your conversion doesn&#039;t fit then there is a possibility of errors. Make sure that the words are associated with each other. Next point is for you to have a word by word perfect conversion. Check the number of syllables. It should match with the audio, otherwise your conversion is an error. The most damaging error are Critical Errors. They must be avoided. What are the messages you need to tag as Unconvertible? you should know it. In lay mans term, those that are not in English and messages wherein more than 50% cannot be converted. Otherwise convert the message. 											\r\n\r\n2) Push Quality Score - They are identified messages. You need to check the message ID of all messages, no excuse on this one. Make sure that before you start your shift, you are already aware of the Push messages converted by the Agents on the earlier shift. This is an advantage you have over them. Best conversion is needed on Push messages. On converting Push messages make sure that you will convert the message first from the start to the end before reviewing or asking assistance.

Goal is to hit the green throughout the shift at any given time. Take note of the following: 1) The use of the predictive text is the most important thing when it comes to HACR improvement. Less key strokes means less time in converting the message. In order to maximize the use of the predictive text make sure that you are always looking at the screen when you type. Look at the right side of the letters to maximize the use of the predictive text. In Connection with this it is necessary that you type accurately so that the correct predictive text will appear immediately. 2)Typing skills - Consider the following questions: are you looking on the keyboard when you type?, Do you use all 10 fingers on the keyboard to type?, Do you know where the keys are on the keyboard without having to look at them? Are you using the numeric keyboard? If your answers these questions is no then go to a typing course on the Internet eg Mavis Beacon http://www.teststeststests.com/typingtest/Visit. 3) Maximize the use of the hotkeys. Make sure you know all of them. 4) Decison Making - It should be fast\r\n\r\nHACR target should be hit on a daily basis onwards. The HACR standard set by the client is 2.99 and it is necessary that your HACR improve. The current trend should stop. Goal is to at least hit 2.99 by the end of the month. Basecamp HACR will be agressively checked on an hourly basis. HACR will be checked to see if the agent will improve or not.\r\n\r\nSome more important pointers:\r\n1) Pay attention to the message throughout the shift\r\n2) Be conscious with your BaseCamp HACR. Have effort on hitting the target\r\n3) You are not anymore on the NVC account. A faster pace and more sense of urgency is needed.\r\n4) Hitting below 4 on the BaseCamp is not enough.
