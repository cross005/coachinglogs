Strictly limit your escalation percentage to 4%. This is one of the major keys in lowering your HACR. To do this, you must: a) Increase your confidence in converting and sending hard messages. b) Manage your escalation. We have already identified the scoring times for PULL messages which is 1700-2000 and 2200-0100 and you were advised not to escalate messages except during these times. c) Treat the escalation as your final resort and not an escape route or an option.\r\n\r\n2. Practice LAR. You may do your Google research during listening phase. This will actually improve both your QA and HACR.\r\n\r\n3. Maximize all available hot keys. You may view them by pressing F2.\r\n\r\n4. You may also utilize the Typing Pal application during idle times to improve your typing skills.\r\n','','Strictly follow our Action Plans.\r\n\r\nKindly state any additional action plans that you think will help you to lower your HACR down.','               I will try to lower my escalation.\r\n               \r\n              ','Will check your Weekly HACR performance on Monday, January 18 and will do weekly performance comparison to see if there&#039;s any improvement made.','leonardo.ampioco.jpg','von.delrosario.jpg','jairus.delossantos.jpg','Ok','Ok','Ok','Approved','von.delrosario','01/13/16 8:12','01/14/16 2:10','01/17/16 5:34'),(479,'20160113182406','joemarie.deles','von.delrosario',21901,'dina.decastro','De Castro, Dina','14:00-23:30','01/13/16 6:24','','You just recently signed an Incident Report for the second offense of Failed Monthly Performance Evaluation (MPE) for the month of December 2015.\r\n\r\nBased on our scorecard as of January 12, 2016, your overall rating is at 1.80.

You must bounce back from your critical error last January 5th and make sure every message you will send is 100% perfect. Take advantage of the identified PULL scoring times. Utilize Google search to identify names, places and company names. Ask for second opinion to avoid critical errors and use your escalation wisely.\r\n\r\nHACR target is at 3.0.
